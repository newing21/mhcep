# MHCEP

## What is MHCEP?

The Mental Health Community Engagement Program (MHCEP) is focused on improving the experience of both mentally ill patients and healthcare professionals when they encounter each other in the healthcare system. 

Founded in 2020 by MD candidates at the Colorado University School of Medicine and community members, MHCEP generates data-driven approaches to solving issues plaguing  the mental healthcare system and aims to revise and improve mental health policy, education, and clinical procedures at scale.   

## Mission

Gaining an understanding of the challenges the mental health community faces and the barriers to seeking appropriate care, as defined by community members, will provide an invaluable learning experience to medical trainees.
